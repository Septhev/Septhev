## What Have I Done So Far?
So far I only really have coded up a Discord Old Font Revert back when Discord implemented their new font which got a lot of hate. I decided to code up a quick fix that would change back the font with the assistance of Discord Theme Changers hoping it would have a temporary fix. In which it partially did but the margins and gui scaling is horrible when applied. Thank god someone made a better one that doesn't requrire Theme Changers.
